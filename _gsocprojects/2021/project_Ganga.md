   [Ganga](https://github.com/ganga-devs/ganga) is a computational task-management tool, which allows for the specification, submission, bookkeeping and post-processing of computational tasks on a wide set of distributed resources.
   Ganga has been developed to solve a problem increasingly common in scientific projects, which is that researchers must regularly switch between different processing systems, each with its own command set, to complete their computational tasks. Ganga provides a homogeneous environment for processing data on heterogeneous resources.
